the concept of stitching an image is basically finding the key point between images that match eacher other and
 then blend them together making the image being able to stitch to each other. However, there must be key points
 between images for stitching to be able to work.
 the process of stitching are:
 1. detection of key points
 2.finding matched descriptor of input images
 3.calculating the coresponding points to each other using an algorithm called RANSAC
 4.the calculation will then be applied to the image in order to warp and fit those images and merge them into one
